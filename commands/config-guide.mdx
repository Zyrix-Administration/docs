## Configuration Interface

Each command in the configuration panel displays:

1. **Toggle Switch**: Enable or disable the command
2. **Command Input**: Customize the command name
3. **Description**: Explanation of what the command does

When a command is disabled:
- The toggle switch turns off
- The command input field becomes disabled
- The command will not be registered on the server

## Best Practices

### Command Naming
- Use clear, memorable command names
- Avoid conflicts with existing server commands
- Consider your community's language and preferences

### Security Considerations
- Disable destructive commands like `kickall` unless absolutely necessary
- Review permissions for each command based on staff roles
- Test commands in a development environment first

### Performance Tips
- Disable unused commands to reduce server load
- Use the "Only Missing" setting to avoid command conflicts
- Regularly review and update your command configuration

## Export/Import Configuration

The configuration can be exported as JSON for backup or sharing:

```json
{
  "commands": {
    "enable": true,
    "skipRegistered": true,
    "ban": { "enabled": true, "command": "ban" },
    "kick": { "enabled": true, "command": "kick" },
    // ... all other commands
  }
}
```

This allows for:
- **Backup**: Save your configuration settings
- **Sharing**: Share configurations between servers
- **Version Control**: Track changes to your setup
- **Migration**: Move settings to new servers

## Troubleshooting

### Commands Not Working
1. Check if "Commands Enabled" is turned on
2. Verify the specific command is enabled
3. Ensure no command name conflicts exist
4. Review server console for error messages

### Command Conflicts
1. Enable "Only Missing" to skip existing commands
2. Use unique command names
3. Check for conflicts with other resources

### Permission Issues
1. Verify staff permissions in the Permissions section
2. Check role assignments for command access
3. Review server-side permission configurations
