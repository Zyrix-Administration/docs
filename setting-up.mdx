## Log into your server from the panel.

After creating your server from the [Redeem License Key](/setup-server) you can now log into
your server by clicking on it.

## Download & Install Zyrix
After logging into your server, you need to visit the **"Overview"** page from the sidebar on the
left. Once you are here you will see an overview of your servers actions with Zyrix. In the top right
you will see a **"Download Zyrix"** button, press that to download Zyrix. Then follow the following
installation steps:

1. Drag the "zyrix_admin" resource into your servers resources.
2. Head to the **Overview** tab on the panel and press the **"Install Zyrix"** button
then a Dialog will pop up with the server.cfg vars required to link your server with the web panel.
3. Copy the code block inside of the dialog and go to your **server.cfg** and **paste** it in there.
4. Start the zyrix_admin resource, and wait to see the "Server Authenticated" message, from there you
can start configuring Zyrix from the web panel.
