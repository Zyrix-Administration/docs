## Overview
Staff permissions are organized into **ranks**. Each rank is a container for permission flags and staff bindings.  
A rank can grant access by:

- **Players** — direct identifiers such as `license:...`, `steam:...`, `discord:...`, or `token:...`
- **Discord Roles** — role snowflake IDs from your guild
- **ACE Permissions** — FiveM ACE strings like `group.admin` or `zyrix.mod`

When a player matches **any** of these bindings, they inherit the rank’s permissions.

## Creating a Rank
1. Navigate to **Permissions** in the sidebar.  
2. Click **New Rank** in the top right.  
3. Enter a descriptive label (e.g. `Owner`, `Moderator`) and save.  

The new rank will appear in the table.

## Editing a Rank
### 1. Adjusting Permissions
1. Click the **Pencil** icon for the rank.  
2. The editor will open with categories (e.g., Self, Online, Vehicle).  
3. Toggle an entire category on/off, or drill down and enable/disable individual permissions.

### 2. Linking Staff
1. Click the **Gear** icon for the rank.  
2. In the dialog, you can bind staff in three ways:
   - **Player Identifiers** — add one or more unique IDs (`license:xxxx`, `steam:xxxx`, etc.)  
   - **Discord Roles** — add role snowflake IDs (requires Discord integration)  
   - **ACE Permissions** — add ACE groups or explicit permission strings  
3. Multiple binding methods can be combined. For example, you can assign a Discord role and also bind a specific player identifier.

### 3. Saving Changes
- After editing, click **Save**.  
- Updates are applied immediately and synced to your server.

## Best Practices
- Create broad ranks (e.g., `Moderator`, `Admin`) instead of many micro-ranks.  
- Use Discord roles for dynamic management. Update roles in Discord, and Zyrix will automatically sync staff access.  
- Use ACE permissions if you want FiveM’s native security model to interoperate with Zyrix.  

<Warning>
For Discord Role linking to work, ensure [Discord Settings](/configuration/discord-settings) are fully configured with a valid Guild ID, Bot Token, and required role permissions.
