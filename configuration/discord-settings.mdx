## Overview
Go to **Configuration → Discord Settings**. Enable the bot. Fill the required fields. Save.

<Warning>
Never paste your bot token publicly. Treat it like a password.
</Warning>

## Bot Toggle
- **Discord Settings**  
  Enables the Discord bot for role management and webhooks.

## Core Fields
- **Guild ID**  
  The Discord server ID (snowflake).  
  - Get it: Discord → User Settings → Advanced → enable *Developer Mode* → right-click your server → **Copy Server ID**.  
  - Example: `123456789012345678`.

- **Bot Token**  
  Token from Discord Developer Portal → *Bot* → **Reset Token**.  
  - Format: `MTA...kQ.Z...`  
  - The bot must be in your guild.

### Required Bot Intents
Grant these on the bot page:
- **Server Members Intent**

Minimum permissions when inviting:
- `Manage Roles` (for role linking)

## Webhooks
Each event has:
- **Enable/Disable slider**  
- **Webhook URL** input

Create a webhook: Discord → *Server Settings* → *Integrations* → *Webhooks* → **New Webhook** → copy URL.

### Events
- **Ban Webhook**
  - Sends when a player is banned.
  - Payload includes: player name/ID, identifiers, reason, expires.

- **Unban Webhook**
  - Sends when a player is unbanned.
  - Payload includes: identifier or ban ID, actor, reason.

- **Kick Webhook**
  - Sends when a player is kicked.
  - Payload includes: player, actor, reason.

- **Warning Webhook**
  - Sends when a player is warned.
  - Payload includes: player, actor, reason.

- **Give-Item Webhook**
  - Sends when staff give items.
  - Payload includes: player, item, amount, actor, identifiers.

- **Revive/Heal Webhook**
  - Sends on revive or heal actions.
  - Payload includes: player, actor, action type.

## Validation
- **Guild ID** must be a numeric string.  
- **Bot Token** must be non-empty and valid.  
- **Webhook URL** must start with `https://discord.com/api/webhooks/`.

## Testing
1. Enable the bot and save.  
2. Confirm the bot is online in your server.  
3. Enable one webhook, paste its URL, save.  
4. Perform a test action (e.g., kick).  
5. Check the target channel for an embed.

## Role Linking Prerequisite
Role-based permissions require:
- Bot in guild with `Manage Roles`.  
- Bot’s highest role above roles it must assign.  
- **Guild ID** and **Bot Token** saved here.

<Note>
See **[Staff Permissions](/configuration/permissions)** for binding ranks to Discord roles.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting
- **No webhook messages**: URL wrong or webhook deleted. Create a new webhook.  
- **Bot offline**: token invalid or bot not in guild. Re-invite and reissue token.  
- **Role sync fails**: missing `Manage Roles` or bot role is too low in hierarchy.  
- **HTTP 401/403 from API**: panel credentials or server license misconfigured.
